# forest cover analysis

### Overview
This is a data science project in the topic of forestry.  
  
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset).  
This is a machine learning project, where the task is to predict the relevant tree species based on environment conditions in the given area.  
The dataset contains around 500k records, there are numerical and categorical features as well.  
  
### Real-world Application
The method can be applied in real world when forest management companies are planning reforestations/afforestations.  
  
### Further Ideas
The method can be improved with meteorological data and predictions. As the climate is changing and the forestry sector plans for decades and centuries, the change in environmental conditions is important from the model perspective.  
In other words, where the conditions are perfect for a specific species now, the situation can be different in 30 years. Therefore if we could add predicted meterological data, it would be even better.
